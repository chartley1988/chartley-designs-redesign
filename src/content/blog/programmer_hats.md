## Introduction

The modern programmer has to wear many hats. As a young man, I started to lose
my hair at a young age... so I wore many hats. But those were ball caps. What
we're talking about here is _metaphorical_ hats. I think the metaphorical hats
a programmer must where are:

- the coder
- the engineer
- the professional
- the human

To be honest, I'm still pretty new in my programming journey, only a couple
years. These are just my observations in my adventure so far. I don't believe
you need to wear all four of that hats perfectly, but you should be aware of
them.

## The coder

The Coder is proficient with their tools, especially their text editor.

- Vim
- VS Code
- Debuggers
- plugins
- Fast typing skills
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Knowing their operating system

## The engineer

The engineer is wise and knowledgeable. They keep in mind:

- performance
- needs of the project
- deep knowledge of programming language and their intracies
- data structures
- maintainability and structure of projects

## the professional

The professional has the right attitude in all circumstances. They:

- work well as a team
- are accountable
- are humble, and willing to learn
- communicate well
- are honest but respecting
- are punctual

## the human

The human knows how to take care of themselves. To be effective at their craft,
they must be in good shape mentally and physically. They:

- Sleep enough
- eat well
- manage their energy levels
- exercise

- manage their mental health
- have good relationships in their life
- enjoy life outside of their work
