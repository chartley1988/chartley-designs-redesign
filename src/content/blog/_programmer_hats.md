## Introduction

The modern programmer has to wear many hats. As a young man, I started to lose
my hair at a young age... I wore many hats. But those were ball caps. What
we're talking about here is _metaphorical_ hats, the kind you wear when you
need to change your perspective on the fly. I think the metaphorical hats
a programmer must wear are:

- the coder
- the engineer
- the professional
- the human

To be honest, I'm still pretty new in my programming journey, only a couple
years. These are just my observations in my adventure so far. I don't believe
you need to wear all four of that hats perfectly, but you should be aware of
them. So, without further ado, let's start with **the coder**.

## The coder

The Coder is proficient with their tools, especially their text editor. I thin
the fundamentals of a good coder are shared with many other computer based
professions. Most of it comes down to knowing your computer, its operating
system, its software, and your accessories. But specifically, what skills make
a really good coder?

### Typing

I think we all hold an image of a coder being an extremely fast typist. I don't
think typing speed is all that important. Programming is more about navigating
your code base, making edits, thinking, and testing. I think the gains from
extreme typing speed would be marginal, much like driving a car above the
limit. All that being said, I think its crucially important to be **able to
type without looking at the keyboard**. I think ability to focus and flow is
important, and constantly looking up and down breaks this. So, master that home
row, focus on being ergonomic and comfortable.

### Text editing

The ability to type leads into the next crucial skill, the ability to edit
text. The ability to edit text depends on both a coders proficiency with the
keyboard and the _text editor_ itself. The choice of editor itself is
subjective, but it is crucial to know it well. Know its shortcuts, know its
ecosystem and plugins, and know its limits. Some editors, like
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) off a novel way to navigate and edit text that can
offer an efficient workflow after some practice. The effective coder uses an
editor they're proficient with.

### Plugins and IDEs

The ecosystem of software for editing code is complicated. Some, like Vim are
purely text editors but can be expanded with plugins to create a more complete
editing environment. Others, like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
are text editors with a much more rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins.
Others yet, are _Integrated
Development Environments_ (IDE), that offer a complete suite of software for
authoring, testing, and automating the production of applications.

Whatever solution you choose, its important to understand its ecosystem, and
whats available for debuggers, linters, code completion, test runners, and
other features crucial for development.

To summarize, the coder knows their tools in depth. I think knowledge of these
things is _distinct_ from knowledge other aspects of programming, such as
language syntax, programming patterns, or application architecture. Those fall
under the umbrella of **the engineer**.

## The engineer

The engineer is wise and knowledgeable. They keep in mind:

- performance
- needs of the project
- deep knowledge of programming language and their intricacies
- data structures
- maintainability and structure of projects

## the professional

The professional has the right attitude in all circumstances. They:

- work well as a team
- are accountable
- are humble, and willing to learn
- communicate well
- are honest but respecting
- are punctual

## the human

The human knows how to take care of themselves. To be effective at their craft,
they must be in good shape mentally and physically. They:

- Sleep enough
- eat well
- manage their energy levels
- exercise
- employ good habits
- manage their mental health
- have good relationships in their life
- enjoy life outside of their work
