## What's wrong with the internet?

- Youtube, twitter, and other social sites suck. They're designed for profit
  and addiction. The algorithms are not great for discovery of new and great
  content, **popularity is not a great indicator for quality**.
- The internet is heavy with AI generated content, or content that is stuffed
  with fluff for SEO. Recipe sites, I'm looking at you.

## What's wrong with us?

### We have super short attention spans

- Short form videos are great for certain things, but don't mass consume them.
- Written content is perhaps the best and longest lasting source of
  information, but we don't give ourselves time to read.

### We have forgotten how to write

- It doesn't help that we use AI to do our writing now.

## Solutions

### Curate a list of awesome websites

- Put them on your websites
- Put them on your link tree
- Explore peoples personal sites more deeply, instead of surfing twitter

### Take your bookmarks more seriously

### Build an RSS feed for your site
