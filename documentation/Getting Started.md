# Getting Started

This is an Astro theme. It features many components and their variations.
Astro generates the app based on the contents of the [Pages](../src/pages/)
folder. As such, this template can provide tons of features without bloating
the final bundle size of the finished product.

The intent of this template is to provide a good running start for an
effective static site for the purposes of freelancing. It represents an
ideal set of features to cover most use-cases of small business, restaurants,
tradesmen, contractors, etc. The approach is to have a good default theme
that is easy to change to fit the needs of the customer. For the developer,
the most important thing is to get out of the way and make implementing the
content the most important thing.

## Recommended Approach

1. Fill out your [Site Summary](Site%20Summary.md) first. This section contains
   side wide metadata. Configure things like the name of your site, choose logo
   file, description of site, etc.

2. Next, [Configure your colors](Configure%20Theme.md). Choose your primary
   and accent colors, and more.

3. Then, [configure your theme](Configure%20Theme.md). Here you can customize
   dark and light theme, which colors to use where, spacing, fonts, shadows, and
   more.

4. [Configure the Layout](Configure%20Layout.md). The Layout file defines
   what's in common for every page on the site. Configure the layout to customize
   metadata, layout, and more. Be default it contains just a header and a footer.
5. Once your happy with the look and feel of the site, start [customizing
   your home page](Customize%20Index%20Page.md) by choosing components to include
   such as a hero or feature cards.
6. [Add some content](Writing%20Content.md)! This template makes it easy to
   add services and features you can provide, or write some blog posts. You
   don't need to make individual pages for these things, let the template do
   the heavy lifting.
