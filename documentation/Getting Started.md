# Getting Started

This is an Astro theme. It features many components and their variations. Astro generates the app based on the contents of the [Pages](../src/pages/) folder. As such, this template can provide tons of features without bloating the final bundle size of the finished product.

The intent of this template is to provide a good running start for an effective static site for the purposes of freelancing. It represents an ideal set of features to cover most use-cases of small business, restaurants, tradesmen, contractors, etc. The approach is to have a good default theme that is easy to change to fit the needs of the customer. For the developer, the most important thing is to get out of the way and make implementing the content the most important thing.
